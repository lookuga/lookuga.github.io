<p>Welcome to the LookugA blog!</p>
<p>LookugA (pronounced: Loo-Ku-Ga) is a side alias I have been using for a while. I used this alias to work upon a number of security and development projects.</p>
<p>This blog will be used to publish my articles on open source related items, hardware and software development and of course security.</p>
<p>I am going to publish a new article at least once every two weeks, it could either be a written/video tutorial, a new security discover or just a general topic I would be interested in at that point in time.</p>
<p>Subscribe to any of the LookugA social media channels to stay updated.<br></p>
